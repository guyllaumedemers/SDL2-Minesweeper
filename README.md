## Issues
> #include \<filestream> namespace is not recognized after 'build configuration files' are generated using cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" in RELEASE mode (\*DEBUG mode works fine), even if CXX_STANDARD 17 is specified. Running MSVC 14.3. CMake 3.22. MSVC compiler should be handling properly \<filesystem> header which is part of the STL but isnt. WIll try building and running using mingw-w64 with gcc compiler.
